logs for my error

I need help. I keep getting a black screen when I'm trying to use display capture on my Windows 10 device. I'm using the Integrated Intel and not the Nvidia. I have also disabled some animations to speed windows up (or to disable "aero"). Game Capture is completely black for anything I try and Display capture doesn't work at all for anything. Window capture works for Chrome with hardware acceleration off, but it doesn't work for my PARSEC game window (my cloud gaming rig).  What should i do? Can anybody read the errors on my log maybe?
